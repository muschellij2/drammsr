# @brief CMake package configuration use file.
#
# @note The @USE_FILE@ file is automatically generated
#       by BASIS from the template file ConfigUse.cmake.in which is part of
#       the BASIS package.
#
# In the default package use file of BASIS, which can be included here using
# the \@BASIS_USE\@ variable, the prefix used by the package configuration
# file is defined as @c NS variable. Thus, to use any variable set by the
# corresponding package configuration file, use code similar to:
#
# @code
# include_directories (${${NS}INCLUDE_DIRS})
# @endcode
#
# See the ConfigUse.cmake.in file of BASIS for details.
#
# @note The CMake code which is substituted for the \@BASIS_USE\@ variable
#       contains an include guard.

# The following statements ensure that all scripts and modules are
# configured/compiled using the same version of the interpreters.
# Yet, the user can modify these variables, though this is not recommended.

# Note: The PERL_EXECUTABLE, and BASH_EXECUTABLE variables have to be cached
#       such that the FindPerl.cmake, and FindBASH.cmake modules find the
#       respective executable.
#
# Attention: DO NOT set PYTHON_EXECUTABLE here. In case of a Slicer Extension,
#            the UseSlicer.cmake file requires us not to set PYTHON_EXECUTABLE
#            before including this file. As the @USE_FILE@ file is included
#            before any other dependency, the PYTHON_EXECUTABLE variable is
#            set by the basis_project_impl() macro.
