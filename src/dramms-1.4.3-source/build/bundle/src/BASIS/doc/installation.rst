Prerequisites
-------------

See the :ref:`BasisBuildDependencies` listed in the :doc:`howto/install` guide
for a list of software tools required to build BASIS. These are further the tools
required to build any software which is based on BASIS. BASIS itself makes moreover
use of the following software packages:

.. The tabularcolumns directive is required to help with formatting the table properly
   in case of LaTeX (PDF) output.

| Package             | Version | Description                                             |
+=====================+=========+=========================================================+
| ITK_                | 3.14    | The standalone ``basistest-driver`` executable currently|
|                     |         | makes use of the ITK, either version 3 or 4 and above,  |
|                     |         | for the comparison of a test image to one or more       |
|                     |         | baseline images. If no installation of this library is  |
|                     |         | found, this executable is excluded from the build and   |
|                     |         | installation. Note that many packages developed at SBIA |
|                     |         | make use of this executable in their tests. If BASIS has|
|                     |         | been built without the ``basistest-driver``, these      |
|                     |         | packages have to be build with the ``BUILD_TESTING``    |
|                     |         | option set to ``OFF`` (the default).                    |
+---------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| MATLAB_             | R2009b  | The MATLAB tools are used by BASIS to build `MEX-Files`_|
|                     |         | from C++ sources. If ``BUILD_TESTING`` is set to ``ON`` |
|                     |         | and the MEX script is found, the tests for the build of |
|                     |         | MEX files are run. Otherwise, these are excluded from   |
|                     |         | the test.                                               |
+---------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| `MATLAB Compiler`_  | R2009b  | The MATLAB Compiler (MCC) is used by BASIS to build     |
|                     |         | stand-alone executables from MATLAB source files.       |
|                     |         | If ``BUILD_TESTING`` is set to ``ON`` and MCC is found, |
|                     |         | the tests for the build of such binaries are run.       |
|                     |         | Otherwise, these are excluded from the test.            |

the documentation of the respective software package.


Build and Installation
----------------------

The build, test, and installation steps which are common to any BASIS based
software, including BASIS itself, are given in the :doc:`howto/install` guide.
