    INTRODUCTION
    ============

      This document defines guidelines on how to style plain text documentation
      files such as the readme file and the build and installation instructions.
      A common style makes it easier for users of software developed at SBIA to
      navigate through the documents and recognize what is of importance to them.
      Moreover, it serves as a branding of the software. Each individual software
      project shall finally be integrated with all the other software projects
      to form one unique software package. Here a common documentation style is
      desired such that the separate subprojects nicely integrate with each other.



    HEADER
    ======

      Each plain text document has to start with the following header with one
      blank line before and each line indented by two space characters.

    HEADINGS
    ========

      Headings of level 1 are capitalized as in this document. All other headings
      are spelled case-sensitive where the first letter of words with four or more
      characters are started with an uppercase letter. Headings of level 1 are
      not intended, while all other headings are intended by two space characters.

      For headings of level 1, a line of = characters as long as the heading is
      used to underline it. For headings of level 2, - characters are used instead.
      All other headings are not underlined.

      Before each heading of level 1, three blank lines are inserted.
      Before each heading of level 2, two blank lines are inserted.
      Before any other heading, one blank line is inserted.

      A heading and its text block are indented by (level - 1) * 2 space characters.
      Hence, headings of level 1 are not indented, while headings of level 2 are
      indented by two space characters.



    TEXT BLOCKS
    ===========

      The number of columns in a text block is limited to about 80 characters.
      Each text block is indented equally to the indentation of its heading,
      where at least two space characters are used to intend a text block.
      Hence, even though headings of level 1 are not indented, so are the
      corresponding text blocks.

      There are no space characters on blank lines.
     


    ENUMERATIONS
    ============

      Use -, +, and * characters as bullet points.
