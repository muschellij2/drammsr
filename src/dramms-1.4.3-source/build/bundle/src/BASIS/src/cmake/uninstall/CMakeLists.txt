# @file  CMakeLists.txt
# @brief Common build configuration file to add uninstaller.
#
# CMake does not support the creation of an uninstaller. Therefore, we add
# code to the cmake_install.cmake file which writes the content of the
# install_manifest.txt file to a file in the installation tree. As this
# code has to be executed after all files were executed and CMake includes
# the cmake_install.cmake files of subdirectories at last, this CMakeLists.txt
# is placed into a shared directory of the BASIS installation which is added
# to every BASIS project using add_subdirctory() at the very end of the root
# CMakeLists.txt file.
