/**
@defgroup BasisMatlabUtilities MATLAB Utilities
@brief    Auxiliary implementations for use in MATLAB scripts.

@todo The MATLAB utilities are not implemented yet. Note, however, that
      for certain utilities provided for other programming languages there
      is no use in MATLAB. For example, the ExecutableTargetInfo module is
      not required as MATLAB does not allow the execution of an executable
      from within MATLAB scripts.
