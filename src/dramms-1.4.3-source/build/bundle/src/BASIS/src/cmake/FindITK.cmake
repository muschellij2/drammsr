# @file  FindITK.cmake
# @brief Find an ITK installation or build tree.
#
# When ITK is found, the ITKConfig.cmake file is sourced to setup the
# location and configuration of ITK.  Please read this file, or
# ITKConfig.cmake.in from the ITK source tree for the full list of
# definitions.  Of particular interest is ITK_USE_FILE, a CMake source file
# that can be included to set the include directories, library directories,
# and preprocessor macros.  In addition to the variables read from
# ITKConfig.cmake, this find module also defines
#
# @par Output variables:
# <table border="0">
#   <tr>
#     @tp @b ITK_DIR @endtp
#     <td>The directory containing ITKConfig.cmake.  
#         This is either the root of the build tree, 
#         or the lib/InsightToolkit directory.  
#         This is the only cache entry.</td>
#   </tr>
#   <tr>
#     @tp @b ITK_FOUND @endtp
#     <td>Whether ITK was found.  If this is true, @c ITK_DIR is okay.</td>
#   </tr>
#   <tr>
#     @tp @b USE_ITK_FILE @endtp
#     <td>The full path to the <tt>UseITK.cmake</tt> file.  
#         This is provided for backward 
#         compatability. Use @c ITK_USE_FILE instead.</td>
