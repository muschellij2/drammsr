# ============================================================================
# library target(s)
# ============================================================================

# Add library target for each library using basis_add_library().
#
# This command can not only be used to build libraries from C/C++, but also source
# code written in other programming languages such as Java, Python, Perl, BASH,
# and MATLAB. Note that here we consider modules written in a scripting language
# which are no executables but to be included by other scripts written in the
# particular language as libraries.



# ============================================================================
# executable target(s)
# ============================================================================

# Add executable target for each executable program using basis_add_executable().
#
# This command can not only be used to build executables from C/C++, but also
# source code written in other programming languages such as Java, Python, Perl,
# BASH, and MATLAB.
