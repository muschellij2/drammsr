# @file  @CONFIG_FILE@
# @brief CMake package configuration file.
#
# @note The @CONFIG_FILE@ file is automatically generated
#       by BASIS from the template file Config.cmake.in which is part of
#       this package.
#
# Variables in this file have to be prefixed by the name of this package.
# In the default package configuration file of BASIS, which can be included
# here using the \@BASIS_CONFIG\@ variable, this prefix is defined as @c NS
# variable. Moreover, the macro basis_set_config() should be used for
# convenience to set any configuration variable, e.g.,
#
# @code
# basis_set_config (INCLUDE_DIR "@INCLUDE_DIR_CONFIG@")
# @endcode
#
# where the variable @c INCLUDE_DIR_CONFIG is set in the ConfigSettings.cmake
# file of the BASIS installation. Note that this statement will set the
# variable ${NS}INCLUDE_DIR, where by default @c NS is the package name
# followed by an underscore (_).
#
# See the Config.cmake.in file of BASIS for details.
