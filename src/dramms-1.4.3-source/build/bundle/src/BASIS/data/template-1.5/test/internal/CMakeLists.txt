# @file  CMakeLists.txt
# @brief Build configuration of internal software tests.
#
# The tests defined by this build configuration file are intended for internal
# use only. They are excluded from the public distribution package which is
# generated by CPack. Reasons for excluding these tests are to reduce the
# size of the distribution package and to avoid reports about failing tests,
# where it is known that the tests will only run successfully within the
# environment of the package provider.
