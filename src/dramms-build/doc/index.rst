Overview
========

**Deformable Registration via Attribute Matching and Mutual-Saliency Weighting (DRAMMS)**
[`MedIA2011 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841510000940>`__], 
is a software package designed for 2D-to-2D and 3D-to-3D image registration tasks.

Some typical applications of DRAMMS include,

- **Cross-subject** registration of the same organ (can be brain, breast, cardiac, etc); 
- **Mono-** and **Multi-modality** registration (MRI, CT, histology);
- **Longitudinal** registration (pediatric brain growth, cancer development, mouse brain development, etc); 
- Registration under **missing correspondences** (e.g., vascular lesions, tumors, histological cuts).


DRAMMS is implemented as a Unix command-line tool. It is fully automatic and easy to use --- users input
two images, and DRAMMS will output the registered image and the associated deformation. No need for pre-segmentation of
structures, or prior knowledge, or human initialization/interventions.
