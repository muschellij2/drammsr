  http://www.cbica.upenn.edu/sbia/software/dramms/installation.html




INSTALLATION (for Developers in SBIA only)
==========================================

  to update the website using sphinx:
  
  suppose the dramms src files are installed in ${DRAMMS_src_dir}, one can either specify another separate folder as ${DRAMMS_build_dir} or to use let DRAMMS_build_dir=${DRAMMS_src_dir}/build in BATH.

  step 1: the same installation as the above for users (the cbica website instructions), except that to turn "BUILD_DOCUMENTATION" to ON (default is OFF).
  step 2: after "make", do
          >> cd ${DRAMMS_build_dir}/bundle/src/DRAMMS-build/doc/
          >> /sbia/sbiasfw/external/python/epd/7.3.1/bin/sphinx-build -c ${DRAMMS_build_dir}/bundle/src/DRAMMS-build/doc ${DRAMMS_src_dir}/doc/ ${DRAMMS_build_dir}/html
          >> cp ${DRAMMS_build_dir}/bundle/src/DRAMMS-build/doc/latex/DRAMMS_Software_Manual.pdf ${DRAMMS_build_dir}/bundle/src/DRAMMS-build/doc/html/_downloads/

  After done, the binaries are in ${DRAMMS_build_dir}/bin, and also in ${DRAMMS_build_dir}/bundle/src/DRAMMS_build/bin
              the website including the new manual is in ${DRAMMS_build_dir}/bundle/src/DRAMMS_build/doc/html
              the manual is in ${DRAMMS_build_dir}/bundle/src/DRAMMS_build/doc/latex/DRAMMS_Software_Manual.pdf
