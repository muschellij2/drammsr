Software License
------------------

All parts of the DRAMMS software that were developed at University of Pennsylvania,
Section of Biomedical Image Analysis (SBIA) (**attribute extraction, attribute matching,
mutual-saliency weighting, deformation mechanism, deformation operations**)
are freely available under a BSD-style open source license that is compatible with the
**Open Source** definition by `The Open Source Initiative`_ and contains no restrictions
on the use of the software. The full SBIA license text is included in the distribution
package and is available online (`SBIA license`_).

The **optimization part** of DRAMMS, however, is based on a modified version of FastPD_,
which is distributed by the University of Crete, Greece and Ecole Centrale de Paris, France,
under a license which only allows the non-commercial use. The use, modification, and re-distribution
of FastPD by SBIA as part of the DRAMMS software are approved by FastPD's owners for the
**research and academic purpose only**. FastPD is further protected by several
international pending patent applications. If you are seeking the commercial use of FastPD or its variant in DRAMMS, please seek an explicit
permission from the patent holders, the University of Crete, Greece and Ecole Centrale de Paris,
France, as listed `here <http://www.csd.uoc.gr/~komod/FastPD/>`__.

The **affine registration** within DRAMMS uses FLIRT_ from the `FMRI Software Library (FSL)`_ and
therefore bears `FSL license <http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Licence>`_ which grants
**non-commercial use only**.

The DRAMMS implementation as provided by SBIA may, without modification,
only be used for **non-commercial research and academic purpose**.

System Requirements
-------------------

**Operating System:** Linux, Mac OS X

**Memory Requirement:** DRAMMS requires a considerable amount of memory.
The exact memory requirement depends on the dimensions of the input images. But generally,
the default use of DRAMMS should `not` consume more than 12GB memory even when
the input images are large (e.g., 1024*1024*600). The memory consumption for some typical image sizes is:

- ~0.5GB for a typical pair of 2D images                (e.g., 256*256),
- ~2.5GB for a typical pair of 3D cardiac/breast images (e.g., 256*256*100),
- ~3.0GB for a typical pair of 3D brain images (small)  (e.g., 256*256*124),
- 4-10GB for a typical pair of 3D brain images (big)     (e.g., 256*256*256).
- 10-11GB for a typical pair of 3D head+neck CT images (big)     (e.g., 512*512*350).

The good thing is that users can choose to use less memory if their system can only
afford less (see :ref:`FAQ.4 <q4>`). Be aware, though, that this may cause a slight
decrease in the registration accuracy.
