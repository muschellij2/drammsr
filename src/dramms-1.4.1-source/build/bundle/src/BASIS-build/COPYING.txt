  PART A. CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT - LICENSE TO SBIA WITH RIGHT TO SUBLICENSE ("CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT").
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. As used in this Contribution Agreement, "you" means the individual contributing
     the Contribution to the Software maintained by SBIA and the institution or
     entity which employs or is otherwise affiliated with such individual in
     connection with such Contribution.

  2. This Contribution Agreement applies to all Contributions made to the Software
     maintained by SBIA, including without limitation Contributions made prior to
     the date of first publication of this Agreement. If at any time you make a
     Contribution to the Software, you represent that (i) you are legally authorized
     and entitled to make such Contribution and to grant all licenses granted in this
     Contribution Agreement with respect to such Contribution; (ii) if your
     Contribution includes any patient data, all such data is de-identified in
     accordance with U.S. confidentiality and security laws and requirements,
     including but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
     Act (HIPAA) and its regulations, and your disclosure of such data for the purposes
     contemplated by this Agreement is properly authorized and in compliance with all
     applicable laws and regulations; and (iii) you have preserved in the Contribution
     all applicable attributions, copyright notices and licenses for any third party
     software or data included in the Contribution.

  3. Except for the licenses granted in this Agreement, you reserve all right,
     title and interest in your Contribution.

  4. You hereby grant to SBIA, with the right to sublicense, a perpetual, worldwide,
     non-exclusive, no charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce,
     make derivative works of, display and distribute the Contribution. If your
     Contribution is protected by patent, you hereby grant to SBIA, with the right
     to sublicense, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
     irrevocable license under your interest in patent rights covering the Contribution,
     to make, have made, use, sell and otherwise transfer your Contribution, alone
     or in combination with any other code.

  5. You acknowledge and agree that SBIA may incorporate your Contribution into
     the Software and may make the Software available to members of the public
     on an open source basis under terms substantially in accordance with the
     Software License set forth in Part B of this Agreement. You further acknowledge
     and agree that SBIA shall have no liability arising in connection with claims
     resulting from your breach of any of the terms of this Agreement.

  6. YOU WARRANT THAT TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE YOUR CONTRIBUTION DOES NOT
     CONTAIN ANY CODE THAT REQUIRES OR PRESCRIBES AN "OPEN SOURCE LICENSE" FOR
     DERIVATIVE WORKS (by way of non-limiting example, the GNU General Public
     License or other so-called "reciprocal" license that requires any derived
     work to be licensed under the GNU General Public License or other
