Deformable Registration via Attribute Matching and Mutual-Saliency Weighting (DRAMMS) [MedIA2011](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841510000940), is a software package designed for 2D-to-2D and 3D-to-3D image registration tasks.

Some typical applications of DRAMMS include,

Cross-subject registration of the same organ (can be brain, breast, cardiac, etc);
Mono- and Multi-modality registration (MRI, CT, histology);
Longitudinal registration (pediatric brain growth, cancer development, mouse brain development, etc);
Registration under missing correspondences (e.g., vascular lesions, tumors, histological cuts).
DRAMMS is implemented as a Unix command-line tool. It is fully automatic and easy to use â€” users input two images, and DRAMMS will output the registered image and the associated deformation. No need for pre-segmentation of structures, or prior knowledge, or human initialization/interventions.
