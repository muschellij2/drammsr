# @brief Default project-dependent settings.
#
# @note The file ProjectSettings.cmake is automatically generated by
#       BASIS from the template file ProjectSettings.cmake.in which is part
#       of the BASIS installation.
#
# @note More general, project-independent settings are defined in the file
#       BasisSettings.cmake which is part of the BASIS installation.
#
# This module defines global CMake constants and variables which are used
# by the BASIS CMake functions and macros. Hence, these values can be used
# to configure the behavior of these functions to some extent without the
# need to modify the functions themselves. It's main purpose is the
# documentation of these variables with the configured values.

# of the package itself. Moreover, if the project is a module of another project,
# the name of the module may optionally be used as part of the namespace as well.
# Namespaces in C++ are usually in lowercase only.

# sourced by other BASH scripts should use a unique prefix for variable and
# function names.
